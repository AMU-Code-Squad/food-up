## Requirements For Running The Project On Your System 👨🏻‍💻

### 🔷 NodeJs

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.


⚠️To begin with the Node JS installation process, first you need to make sure you have sufficient space and your RAM is at least 4GB

#### Steps to set up NodeJS

* Go to the official download page of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* In the downloads page, you will see various versions of Node. All you need to do is, click on the box, suitable to your system configurations (MAC, Windows Or Linux).
* Once you have successfully downloaded the software, go to the downloaded file, and double-click on it.
* As soon as you click on the file, an installation wizard will come up. Select ‘Next’ and move further with the installation.
* After the installation is done, NodeJs is successfully set up. You can run ```node --version``` to confirm the installation.

### 🔷 Git

Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.


#### Steps to set up Git

* Go to the official [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the installer for your OS.
* Proceed with the installation step as recommended by the installer. 
⚠️It's not recommended to enable settings not recommended by the installer by default.
* Git will be installed on your system, By running ```git --version``` you can verify the success of the installation.


### 🔷 Express JS (Optional)
Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node JS.


#### Steps to set up ExpressJS

* Since you have already got NodeJS installed, we can take the help of the Node Package Manager (**NPM**), to proceed with the installation of ExpressJS.
* Go to your terminal and run the command ```npm install express```
* The node package manager will install the latest version of ExpressJS on your system.

## Setting Up The Project On Your System💻

### 🔶 Cloning The Repository

#### Since you have already set up Git, it's going to be a piece of cake 🍰

* Create a new folder where you would like the files of the repository to go.
* open the windows terminal on the diectory and run ```git clone https://github.com/AMU-Code-Squad/food-up```
* Done!🎉 ,Git will clone all the files into your system.

### 🔶 Getting The Dependencies Ready & Running The Server

#### As we have now cloned the repository, it's time to get all the dependencies required to run the app, to do this simply run the following two commands in the terminal

* For Windows - ```npm install -g --force nodemon```
* For Linux, run ```sudo npm install -g --force nodemon```
* Run ```npm install``` in the home directory, to let npm install all the essential packages from package.json
* Finally! To run the project on your system, type ```nodemon app.js``` on the terminal and view the site on ```http://localhost:3000/``` 🥳
